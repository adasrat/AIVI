This Python script uses YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, version 8) for real-time object detection via a webcam. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Importing Required Libraries
from ultralytics import YOLO
import cv2
ultralytics.YOLO: This is used to load and run the YOLOv8 model for object detection.
cv2 (OpenCV): Used for accessing the webcam, processing images, and displaying the output.


2. Loading the YOLOv8 Model
model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")  # Load a pre-trained YOLOv8 model
Loads the YOLOv8 Nano model (yolov8n.pt), which is a lightweight, pre-trained model for object detection.
The model is trained to detect multiple object classes.


3. Capturing Video from a Camera
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(1)  # Change 1 to the correct camera index
cv2.VideoCapture(1) initializes the webcam.
The argument 1 represents the camera index (change it to 0 if using the default webcam).

4. Processing Frames in a Loop
while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break
cap.isOpened(): Checks if the webcam is accessible.
cap.read(): Reads a frame from the webcam.
If ret is False, it means the frame couldn't be captured, so the loop exits.


5. Running YOLOv8 on Each Frame
results = model(frame)  # Run object detection
The YOLOv8 model processes the frame, identifying objects in the image.


6. Extracting Detection Results
for r in results:
    for box in r.boxes:
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, box.xyxy[0])  # Bounding box coordinates
        confidence = box.conf[0].item()  # Confidence score
        label = r.names[int(box.cls[0])]  # Object class label
r.boxes contains detected objects.
Each box includes:
Bounding Box Coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2): Defines the region where the object is detected.
Confidence Score (box.conf[0]): How certain the model is about the detection.
Class Label (box.cls[0]): The detected objectâ€™s name (e.g., "person", "car").


7. Drawing Bounding Boxes and Labels
cv2.rectangle(frame, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (0, 255, 0), 2)
cv2.putText(frame, f"{label}: {confidence:.2f}", (x1, y1 - 10),
            cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.5, (0, 255, 0), 2)
Draws a bounding box around detected objects.
Adds a label above the box showing the detected object and its confidence score.
Color (0, 255, 0) = Green.


8. Displaying the Video Output
cv2.imshow("Object Detection", frame)
if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord("q"):
    break
Displays the frame with detections in a window.
Pressing "q" exits the loop.


9. Releasing Resources
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
Releases the webcam to avoid resource leaks.
Closes all OpenCV windows.
Summary
Loads a YOLOv8 model.
Captures live video from the webcam.
Runs real-time object detection.
Draws bounding boxes and labels for detected objects.
Displays the processed video.
Stops when "q" is pressed.
